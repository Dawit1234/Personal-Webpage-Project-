            <!-- Content about yourself -->
            <p>My name is Dawit, and I am an active duty soldier stationed at Fort Riley, KS, serving as a supply specialist in the United States Army. My role involves ensuring my unit is well-equipped by managing tasks such as ordering, receiving, and distributing supplies, as well as preparing packages for transfer to other units and battalions. While my primary focus lies in military logistics, I'm concurrently pursuing a degree in Computer Science.</p>
            <p>Before my service in the US Army, I earned a bachelor's degree in Management Information Systems. My transition to Computer Science stems from a deep interest in exploring the realm of Artificial Intelligence post-military service. What I value most about my current role is the diverse interactions I have with individuals from various corners of the globe. These experiences continuously shape my perspective and contribute to my growth. Beyond my professional pursuits, I cherish moments spent reading and creating cherished memories with my family during my leisure time.</p>
